                        <h2>This is a game of murderous intent in order to liberate yourself from a dream, or maybe better said, a nightmare.
                        <br>
                            A world filled with eldritch horrors awaits you, the hunter. 
                            The path you face is one of uncerntainty, and how you decide to end this nightmare is yours to choose.
                            Will you succumb to the nightmare and live inside of it, forever aiding newcomers? Will you slay this nightmare and become one yourself?
                            Or will you simply allow yourself to awaken as if nothing had ever happened? 
                            Whatever you feel compelled to do it is inevitable that you wander this nightmare and face both friend and foe until the secrets of 
                            this world are revealed. Only then will you be able to decide your own fate, as well as the fate of this world.
